    " Answer : A database is a structured collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated easily. It serves as a central repository of information for an organization, making it easier to store, retrieve, and analyze data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases. SQL databases are relational databases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing and querying data. They are typically used for applications where data is highly structured, and relationships between data are well defined. SQL databases are highly scalable and are commonly used in enterprise applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use SQL for managing and querying data. They are typically used for applications where data is unstructured or semi-structured, and relationships between data are not well defined. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Data Structure: SQL databases store data in tables with predefined columns and data types, while NoSQL databases store data in documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. b. Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means they can handle increased traffic by increasing the hardware resources of a single server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means they can handle increased traffic by adding more servers to a cluster. c. Querying: SQL databases use SQL queries for managing and querying data, while NoSQL databases use proprietary APIs or query languages. d.ACID Compliance: SQL databases are generally ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, which means they guarantee data consistency and integrity even in the event of system failures. NoSQL databases are generally BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) compliant, which means they prioritize availability and scalability over data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, SQL databases are ideal for applications that require complex queries and transactions, while NoSQL databases are ideal for applications that require high scalability and performance."

    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "D. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all data from an existing table, but it does not delete the table structure. For example, the following SQL statement deletes all data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers; In summary, DDL statements such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used to define, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and procedures.

    " Answer :Primary Key and Foreign Key are important concepts in relational database design that help establish relationships between tables in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Primary Key: A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. A primary key constraint ensures that the values in the primary key column(s) are unique and not null. A primary key is used to ensure data integrity and consistency by preventing duplicate rows and maintaining referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"students\" table with columns \"id\", \"name\", and \"email\". The \"id\" column can be set as the primary key to ensure that each student has a unique ID number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```CREATE\n",
    "   id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "   name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "   email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL\n",
    ");```\n",
    "\n",
    "B. `Foreign Key`:\n",
    "    A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. A foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table. A foreign key is used to establish relationships between tables and maintain referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"courses\" table with columns \"id\", \"name\", and \"instructor_id\". The \"instructor_id\" column can be set as a foreign key to refer to the \"id\" column in the \"instructors\" table:\n",

    "   id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "   name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "   instructor_id INT NOT NULL,\n",
    "   FOREIGN KEY (instructor_id) REFERENCES instructors(id)\n",
    ");```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"instructor_id\" column in the \"courses\" table refers to the \"id\" column in the \"instructors\" table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables and ensures that every instructor ID in the \"courses\" table corresponds to a valid ID in the \"instructors\" table."
